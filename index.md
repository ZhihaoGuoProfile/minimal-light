## About Me

I am Zhihao Guo([215612096@csu.edu.cn](mailto:215612096@csu.edu.cn)), a motivated and dedicated student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Resources and Environment at [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mengjie Tian](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/tianmengjie/zh_CN/index.htm). My academic journey has been shaped by a strong focus on mineral processsing and environmental resource management.

In my ongoing Master's program, I have been immersed in a dynamic academic environment, exploring subjects such as Flotation Interface Chemistry, Advancements in Mineral Processing, Advanced Research Techniques in Contemporary Resource Processing, and the Application of Computational Chemistry and Fluid Dynamics in Mineral Processing Simulation. These courses have not only deepened my understanding of **mineral processing** but have also provided me with the tools to tackle contemporary **environmental resource** challenges.

My educational foundation was built during my **Bachelor's degree** in Mineral Processing Engineering at [Wuhan Institute of Technology](http://www.wit.edu.cn/index.htm
). The curriculum included essential subjects like Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Principle and Application of Flotation Reagent, and Mineralogy and Petrology. These studies have equipped me with a comprehensive knowledge base to address mineral processing and environmental resource management challenges effectively.

My academic journey has fueled my passion for making a positive impact in the field of mineral processing and environmental resource management. I am excited to continue exploring this field, conducting meaningful research, and applying my knowledge to real-world problems. I am confident that my dedication and educational background will enable me to contribute effectively to the academic and industrial spheres in my chosen field.

Should you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me at [215612096@csu.edu.cn](mailto:215612096@csu.edu.cn)

## Research Interests

- **Surfactants:** design and synthesis of flotation collectors
- **Surface and interface:** solid surface, solid-liquid interface
- **Functional materials:** anodes materials for lithium-ion batterie

## Current Endeavors
My current research primarily revolves around the modification of oleic acid (OA) as a flotation collector. While oleic acid is a commonly used flotation reagent, it presents limitations such as poor selectivity and low solubility at low temperatures, which have restricted its application. Our objective is to improve its flotation performance by altering its chemical structure. Our primary research methodology involves utilizing first-principle calculations to identify the optimal structural modifications for OA and subsequently validating these modifications through experimental techniques.

## Awards
